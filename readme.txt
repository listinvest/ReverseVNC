239kb VNC dropper that will have the vnc server connectback to you on the ip::port you set.
good for tech who need to remotely administrate a client who is behind a router.
not really a trojan because the person will see the tray icon and you moving their mouse :/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
get the tight vnc viewer http://www.tightvnc.com/download.html
set it to listen  vncviewer -listen
make sure you have the appropriate port forwarded on your router

open the editor.exe
[...] browse for the server
read the settings
input your ip::port (make sure u have ::)
write new settings
send to customer


things u might think are bugs:
omg it shows the icon in the system tray!!! , yea so what the priv version will have the icon removed
